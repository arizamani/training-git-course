1 - we use "config" module to save our envirnment configuration
so we install it in our project:
    npm i config
and add dir named "config" with 4 files in it:
- default.json
- development.json
- production.json
- custom-environmetn-variables.json

2 - we don't save password in noraml config json file
we should use mapping system for example we have password in 
envronment variable:
    set app_password=@Ari6222836
we make a file called "custom-environment-variables.json" in config directory.
then we make property in like this:
    {
        "mail":{
            "password":"app_password"
        }
    }
